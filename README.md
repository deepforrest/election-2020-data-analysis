# election-2020-data-analysis
Short program created in Python to see election results on a state-by-state basis which provides statistical insights.  Will not be considered finalized until votes are certified.

OVERVIEW

I began this project when I noticed I was watching the election intensely... perhaps, too intensely.  I decided "why not make a coding project out of it?" and so I did.

This project crunches all the data to provide insights on the election and flags who won each state and their margins of victory.  

The outputs are in the form of analytical prints for now, and I aim to make the data more visual later on.

Enjoy!
